# MSDS458 Deep Learning an Artificial Intelligence

This was an elective class that I took in my Northwestern Data Science Masters program. It focused on using Tensorflow to understand how Deep Learning algorithms work and how to apply them to business problems. 

In this repository I share my various coding assignments that I put together:

**1. XOR Problem:** This is the foundation of Deep Learning. This seemingly simple problem demonstrates the power of Deep Learning: it's ability to solve nonlinear problems.

**2. Assignment 1 - MNIST:** This first assignment deals with neural networks for classification of images. The structure of the network should be simple, with only one internal/hidden layer. The intent of the assignment is to get hands-on, practical experience with not only designing, training, and assessing a neural network, and interpreting the impact of hyperparameters, but to go one step further. 
This assignment uses the MNIST handwritten digit data. The objective is to train a model to classify handwritten numbers correctly.

**3. Assignment 2 - CIFAR 10:** This is another image classification project. This time I use more advanced models to try to achieve better accuracy. The CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) is used for this assignment. It is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. It is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning research. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class.

**4. Assignment 3 - Text Classification:** This assignment involved using DNNs to classify text. For this assignment we used the AG's news topic classification dataset. It is constructed by choosing 4 largest classes (World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech) from the original corpus. Each class contains 30,000 training samples and 1,900 testing samples. The total number of training samples is 120,000 and testing 7,600. Modeling techniques such as RNNS, LSTM/GRU, and 1D CNNs were employed.
