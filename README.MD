# MSDS458 Deep Learning an Artificial Intelligence

This was an elective class that I took in my Northwestern Data Science Masters program. It focused on using Tensorflow to understand how Deep Learning algorithms work and how to apply them to business problems. 

In this repository I share my various coding assignments that I put together:

1. XOR Problem: This is the foundation of Deep Learning. This seemingly simple problem demonstrates the power of Deep Learning: it's ability to solve nonlinear problems.
2.
